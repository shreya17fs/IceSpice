<p>The film is a light hearted and fun watch. It was a very cute story about a girl named Lara Jean. She writes secret, soul-baring letters to her five crushes, but never meant to send them. Now they are out and wreaking havoc on her life.</p>

<p>This film shines from start to finish, and runs the gamut of emotions. The cinematography, sets, and costumes are brilliant. The sparkling performances of six of India's leading actors alone makes the movie worth seeing.</p>
