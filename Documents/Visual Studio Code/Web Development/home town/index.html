                It is said that the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, built the Kedarnath temple as a way to atone for their sins. According to the legend, Lord Shiva tried to evade the Pandavas by taking the form of a bull, but was finally cornered by the Pandavas at Kedarnath. Lord Shiva then disappeared into the ground, leaving only his hump on the surface. The temple is believed to be built on the spot where Lord Shiva disappeared into the ground.
